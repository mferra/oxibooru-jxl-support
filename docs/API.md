## General rules

### Authentication

Authentication is achieved by means of [basic HTTP
auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or through the
use of [user token authentication](#user-token-authentication). For this
reason, it is recommended to connect through HTTPS. There are no sessions, so
every privileged request must be authenticated. Available privileges depend on
the user's rank. The way how rank translates to privileges is defined in the
server's configuration.

It is recommended to add `?bump-login` GET parameter to the first request in a
client "session" (where the definition of a session is up to the client), so
that the user's last login time is kept up to date.

### User token authentication

User token authentication works similarly to [basic HTTP
auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). Because it
operates similarly to ***basic HTTP auth*** it is still recommended to connect
through HTTPS. The authorization header uses the type of `Token` and the
username and token are encoded as Base64 and sent as the second parameter.

Example header for user1:token-is-more-secure
```
Authorization: Token dXNlcjE6dG9rZW4taXMtbW9yZS1zZWN1cmU=
```

The benefit of token authentication is that beyond the initial login to acquire
the first token, there is no need to transmit the user password in plaintext
via basic auth. Additionally tokens can be revoked at anytime allowing a
cleaner interface for isolating clients from user credentials.

### Basic requests

Every request must use `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept:
application/json`. An exception to this rule are requests that upload files.

### File uploads

Requests that upload files must use `multipart/form-data` encoding. Any request
that bundles user files, must send the request data (which is JSON) as an
additional file with the special name of `metadata` with `Content-Type: application/json`
(whereas the actual files must have names specific to the API that is being used).

Alternatively, the server can download the files from the Internet on client's
behalf. In that case, the request doesn't need to be specially encoded in any
way. The files, however, should be passed as regular fields appended with a
`Url` suffix. For example, to use `http://example.com/file.jpg` in an API that
accepts a file named `content`, the client should pass
`{"contentUrl":"http://example.com/file.jpg"}` as a part of the JSON message
body. When creating or updating post content using this method, the server can
also be configured to employ [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to
download content from popular sites such as youtube, gfycat, etc. Access to
yt-dlp can be configured with the `'uploads:use_downloader'` permission

For security (SSRF protection), only `http`/`https` URLs are accepted, and the
server refuses to connect to private, loopback, link-local, or other
non-public addresses (including cloud metadata endpoints) — both for the
initial URL and for any redirects it follows. Downloads are also subject to a
maximum size and a request timeout. As a result, `Url`-suffixed fields can only
point at publicly reachable internet addresses.

Finally, in some cases the user might want to reuse one file between the
requests to save the bandwidth (for example, reverse search + consecutive
upload). In this case one should use [temporary file
uploads](#uploading-temporary-file), and pass the tokens returned by the API as
regular fields appended with a `Token` suffix. For example, to use previously
uploaded data, which was given token `deadbeef`, in an API that accepts a file
named `content`, the client should pass `{"contentToken":"deadbeef"}` as part
of the JSON message body. If the file with the particular token doesn't exist
or it has expired, the server will show an error.

### Error handling

All errors (except for unhandled fatal server errors) send relevant HTTP status
code together with JSON of following structure:

```json5
{
    "name": "Name of the error, e.g. 'PostNotFound'",
    "title": "Generic title of error message, e.g. 'Resource Not Found'",
    "description": "Detailed description of what went wrong, e.g. 'User `rr-` not found."
}
```

A full list of error names can be found in the OpenAPI docs.

### Field selecting

For performance considerations, sometimes the client might want to choose the
fields the server sends to it in order to improve the query speed. This
customization is available for top-level fields of most of the
[resources](#resources). To choose the fields, the client should pass
`?fields=field1,field2,...` suffix to the query. This works regardless of the
request type (`GET`, `PUT` etc.).

For example, to list posts while getting only their IDs and tags, the client
should send a `GET` query like this:

```
GET /posts/?fields=id,tags
```

### Versioning

To prevent problems with concurrent resource modification, oxibooru
implements optimistic locks using resource versions. Each modifiable resource
has its `version` returned to the client with `GET` requests. At the same time,
each `PUT` and `DELETE` request sent by the client must present the same
`version` field to the server with value as it was given in `GET`.

For example, given `GET /post/1`, the server responds like this:

```
{
    ...,
    "version": 2024-09-14T19:06:56.979184564Z
}
```

This means the client must then send `{"version": 2024-09-14T19:06:56.979184564Z}`
back too. If the client fails to do so, the server will reject the request notifying
about missing parameter. If someone has edited the post in the mean time, the server
will reject the request as well, in which case the client is encouraged to notify the
user about the situation.


### Webhooks

System administrators can choose to configure webhooks to track events.
Webhook URIs can be configured in `config.yaml` (See `config.yaml.dist` for
example). Upon any event, the API will send a `POST` request to the listed
URIs with a [snapshot resource](#snapshot) generated with anonymous user
privileges as the message body, in JSON format.

        "implications": [<name1>, <name2>, ...], // optional
        "suggestions":  [<name1>, <name2>, ...]  // optional
    }
    ```

- **Output**

    implications must match `tag_name_regex` from server's configuration.
    Category must exist and is the same as `name` field within
    [`<tag-category>` resource](#tag-category). If specified implied tags or
    suggested tags do not exist yet, they will be automatically created. Tags
    created automatically have no implications, no suggestions, one name and
    their category is set to the first tag category found. All fields except
    the [`version`](#versioning) are optional - update concerns only provided
    fields.

### Deleting tag

### Featuring post
- **Request**

    `POST /featured-post`

- **Input**

    ```json5
    {
        "id": <post-id>
    }
    ```

### Creating post
- **Request**

    `POST /posts/`

- **Input**

    ```json5
    {
        "tags":        [<tag1>, <tag2>, <tag3>],
        "safety":      <safety>,
        "source":      <source>,                    // optional
        "description": <description>,               // optional
        "relations":   [<post1>, <post2>, <post3>], // optional
        "notes":       [<note1>, <note2>, <note3>], // optional
        "flags":       [<flag1>, <flag2>],          // optional
        "anonymous":   <anonymous>                  // optional
    }
    ```

- **Files**

    - `content` - the content of the post.
    - `thumbnail` - the content of custom thumbnail (optional).

- **Output**

    A [post resource](#post).

- **Errors**

    - tags have invalid names
    - safety, notes or flags are invalid
    - relations refer to non-existing posts
    - privileges are too low

- **Description**

    Creates a new post. If specified tags do not exist yet, they will be
    automatically created. Tags created automatically have no implications, no
    suggestions, one name and their category is set to the first tag category
    found. Safety must be any of `"safe"`, `"sketchy"` or `"unsafe"`. Relations
    must contain valid post IDs. If `<flag>` is omitted, they will be defined
    by default (`"loop"` will be set for all video posts, and `"sound"` will be
    auto-detected). Sending empty `thumbnail` will cause the post to use default
    thumbnail. If `anonymous` is set to truthy value, the uploader name won't be
    recorded (privilege verification still applies; it's possible to disallow
    anonymous uploads completely from config.) For details on how to pass `content`
    and `thumbnail`, see [file uploads](#file-uploads).

### Merging posts
- **Request**

    `POST /post-merge/`

- **Input**

    ```json5
    {

        "mergeTo":        <target-post-id>,
        "replaceContent": <true-or-false>
    }
    ```

- **Errors**

    - the version of either post is outdated
    - the source or target post does not exist
    - the source post is the same as the target post
    - privileges are too low

- **Description**

    Removes source post and merges all of its tags, relations, scores,
    favorites and comments to the target post. If `replaceContent` is set to
    true, content of the target post is replaced using the content of the
    source post; otherwise it remains unchanged. Source post properties such as
    its safety, source, whether to loop the video and other scalar values do
    not get transferred and are discarded.

        "source":    <source>,                    // optional

    HTTP field, only formatted in a manner consistent with other dates. Values
    in `config` key are taken directly from the server config, with the
    exception of privilege array keys being converted to lower camel case to
    match the API convention.

### Uploading temporary file

- Pool category snapshot data (`<resource-type> = "pool_category"`)

    *Example*

    ```json5
    {
        "name":  "collection",
        "color": "#00FF00",
        "default": false
    }
    ```

- Pool snapshot data (`<resource-type> = "pool"`)

    *Example*

    ```json5
    {
        "names":    ["primes", "primed", "primey"],
        "category": "mathematical",
        "posts":    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    }
    ```


**`<data>` field for modification snapshots**

The value is a property-wise recursive diff between previous version of the
resource and its current version. Its structure is a `<dictionary-diff>` of
dictionaries as created by creation snapshots, which is described below.

`<primitive>`: any primitive (number or a string)

`<anything>`: any dictionary, list or primitive

`<dictionary-diff>`:

```json5
{
    "type": "object change",
    "value":
    {
        "property-of-any-type-1":
        {
            "type": "deleted property",
            "value": <anything>
        },
        "property-of-any-type-2":
        {
            "type": "added property",
            "value": <anything>
        },
        "primitive-property":
        {
            "type": "primitive change",
            "old-value": "<primitive>",
            "new-value": "<primitive>"
        },
        "list-property": <list-diff>,
        "dictionary-property": <dictionary-diff>
    }
}
```

`<list-diff>`:

```json5
{
    "type": "list change",
    "removed": [<anything>, <anything>],
    "added": [<anything>, <anything>]
}
```

Example - a diff for a post that has changed source and has one note added.
Note the similarities with the structure of post creation snapshots.

```json5
{
    "type": "object change",
    "value":
    {
        "source":
        {
            "type": "primitive change",
            "old-value": None,
            "new-value": "new source"
        },
        "notes":
        {
            "type": "list change",
            "removed": [],
            "added":
            [
                {"polygon": [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]], "text": "new note"}
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Since the snapshot dictionaries structure is pretty immutable, you probably
won't see `added property` or `deleted property` around. This observation holds
true even if the way the snapshots are generated changes - szurubooru stores
just the diffs rather than original snapshots, so it wouldn't be able to
generate a diff against an old version.

**`<data>` field for deletion snapshots**

Same as creation snapshot. In emergencies, it can be used to reconstruct
deleted entities. Please note that this does not constitute as means against
vandalism (it's still possible to cause chaos by mass editing - this should be
dealt with by configuring role privileges in the config) or replace database
backups.

**`<data>` field for merge snapshots**

A tuple containing 2 elements:

- resource type equivalent to `<resource-type>` of the target entity.
- resource ID equivalent to `<resource-id>` of the target entity.


### Unpaged search result
**Description**

A result of search operation that doesn't involve paging.

**Structure**

```json5
{
    "results": [
        <resource>,
        <resource>,
        <resource>
    ]
}
```

**Field meaning**
- `<resource>`: any resource - which exactly depends on the API call. For
  details on this field, check the documentation for given API call.

### Paged search result
**Description**

A result of search operation that involves paging.

**Structure**

```json5
{
    "query":    <query>,  // same as in input
    "offset":   <offset>, // same as in input
    "limit":    <page-size>,
    "total":    <total-count>,
    "results": [
        <resource>,
        <resource>,
        <resource>
    ]
}
```

**Field meaning**
- `<query>`: the query passed in the original request that contains standard
  [search query](#search).
- `<offset>`: the record starting offset, passed in the original request.
- `<page-size>`: number of records on one page.
- `<total-count>`: how many resources were found. To get the page count, divide
  this number by `<page-size>`.
- `<resource>`: any resource - which exactly depends on the API call. For
  details on this field, check the documentation for given API call.


### Image search result
**Description**

A result of reverse image search operation.

**Structure**

```json5
{
    "exactPost": <exact-post>,
    "similarPosts": [
        {
            "distance": <distance>,
            "post": <similar-post>
        },
        {
            "distance": <distance>,
            "post": <similar-post>
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Field meaning**
-  `exact-post`: a [post resource](#post) that is exact byte-to-byte duplicate
   of the input file. May be `null`.
- `<similar-post>`: a [post resource](#post) that isn't exact duplicate, but
   visually resembles the input file.
- `<distance>`: distance from the original image (0..1). The lower this value
   is, the more similar the post is.

## Search

Search queries are built of tokens that are separated by spaces. Each token can
be of following form:

| Syntax            | Token type        | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `<value>`         | anonymous tokens  | basic filters                              |
| `<key>:<value>`   | named tokens      | advanced filters                           |
| `sort:<style>`    | sort style tokens | sort the results                           |
| `special:<value>` | special tokens    | filters usually tied to the logged in user |

Anonymous and named tokens support ranged and composite values that
take following form:

| `<value>` | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `a,b,c`   | will show things that satisfy either `a`, `b` or `c`. |
| `1..`     | will show things that are equal to or greater than 1. |
| `..4`     | will show things that are equal to at most 4.         |
| `1..4`    | will show things that are equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4.      |

Date/time values can be of following form:

- `today`
- `yesterday`
- `<year>`
- `<year>-<month>`
- `<year>-<month>-<day>`

Some fields, such as user names, can take wildcards (`*`).

All tokens can be negated by prepending them with -.

Sort style token values can be appended with ,asc or ,desc to control the sort 
direction, which can be also controlled by negating the whole token.

You can escape special characters such as `:`, `*`, and `,` by prepending them with a
backslash: `\\`.

**Example**

Searching for posts with following query:

    sea -fav-count:8.. type:png uploader:Pirate,Davy

will show png files tagged as sea, that were liked by seven people at most,
uploaded by user Pirate or Davy.

Searching for posts with `re:zero` will show an error message about unknown
named token.

Searching for posts with `re\:zero` will show posts tagged with `re:zero`.
